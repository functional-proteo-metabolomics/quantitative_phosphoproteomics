These scripts were used for analyzing the phosphoproteome data from Ovarian cancer tissue and SKOV3 cell line.


# Requirements:
These scripts depend on the following packages, which can be installed in R:
reshape
ggplot2
eulerr
wesanderson
clusterProfiler-
tidyverse
stringr
ggseqlogo



# Before running these scripts some things have to be specified:
All the search files has been submitted to ProteomeXchange with PXD030450 identifier. 
The phosphosites identification and quantification information are extrated from the "Phospho (STY)Sites.txt" .
The phospho-peptides identification information are extrated from the "modificationSpecificPeptides.txt" .
The b and y ion information are extracted from the "msms/.txt"
